# üöÄ AWS CI/CD Pipeline with Terraform & ECS

A fully automated cloud deployment pipeline that demonstrates modern DevOps practices using AWS services, Terraform infrastructure-as-code, and GitHub Actions CI/CD. This project focuses on showcasing the complete end-to-end automation flow rather than building a production-grade application.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete AWS infrastructure provisioned with Terraform
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker-based application deployment on ECS
- **Automated CI/CD**: Zero-touch deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions
- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Leverages AWS ECR, ECS, EC2, and IAM services
- **Fast Deployment**: End-to-end deployment in under 2 minutes
- **Production-Ready Infrastructure**: Includes proper networking, security, and scaling configurations

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Cloud Provider**: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform
- **Container Orchestration**: Amazon ECS on EC2
- **Container Registry**: Amazon ECR
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Application**: Python (simple demonstration app)
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Networking**: VPC, Subnets, Security Groups
- **Identity & Access**: IAM Roles and Policies

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Flow

```
Developer Push ‚Üí GitHub Actions ‚Üí Docker Build ‚Üí ECR Push ‚Üí ECS Update ‚Üí EC2 Deployment
```

1. **Code Push**: Developer pushes code changes to GitHub repository
2. **CI Trigger**: GitHub Actions workflow automatically triggers
3. **Image Build**: Docker image is built with latest application code
4. **Registry Push**: Built image is pushed to Amazon ECR
5. **Service Update**: ECS service and task definition are automatically updated
6. **Container Deploy**: EC2 instances pull and run the new container image
7. **Live Application**: Updated application is live and accessible

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Infrastructure Provisioning
Terraform creates and manages all AWS resources including:
- **ECR Repository**: Stores Docker images
- **ECS Cluster**: Manages container orchestration on EC2 instances
- **VPC & Networking**: Secure network configuration with subnets and security groups
- **IAM Roles**: Proper permissions for services to interact securely
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across container instances

### Continuous Integration/Deployment
The GitHub Actions pipeline automates the entire deployment process:
- Builds Docker image on every code push
- Pushes image to ECR with proper tagging
- Updates ECS task definition with new image
- Triggers rolling deployment with zero downtime
- Provides deployment status and rollback capabilities

## üéØ Project Focus

This project prioritizes demonstrating the **complete automation workflow** rather than building a complex application or enterprise-level production setup. The Python application serves as a simple vehicle to showcase:

- End-to-end CI/CD automation
- Infrastructure as Code principles
- Cloud-native deployment patterns
- DevOps best practices integration

The emphasis is on the **flow and automation mechanics** that can be applied to any application, making it a valuable learning and demonstration tool for modern deployment practices.
