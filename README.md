# 📊 Cost & Usage Monitoring Dashboard

**A comprehensive DevOps monitoring solution demonstrating containerization, observability, and cloud integration using Docker, Prometheus, Grafana, and AWS Free Tier.**

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project showcases end-to-end DevOps practices by building a fully containerized monitoring stack that provides real-time visibility into system performance and AWS cloud costs. The solution demonstrates proficiency in modern observability tools, Docker orchestration, and cloud service integration while maintaining cost-efficiency through AWS Free Tier usage.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern cloud environments present significant monitoring challenges:

- **Fragmented Visibility**: Metrics scattered across multiple systems and services
- **Cost Blindness**: Lack of real-time awareness of cloud spending and resource utilization
- **Manual Monitoring**: Time-consuming, error-prone manual checks across different platforms
- **Scalability Issues**: Difficulty in maintaining consistent monitoring as infrastructure grows
- **Integration Complexity**: Challenges in correlating system metrics with cloud service costs

Organizations need **centralized, cost-aware observability** that provides both technical performance insights and financial awareness in a single, accessible dashboard.

## 💡 Note on AWS Free Tier Metrics

### Why AWS Metrics May Show Zero Values

This project intentionally leverages the **AWS Free Tier** to demonstrate cloud integration capabilities without incurring costs. As a result:

- **Minimal Resource Usage**: AWS services show zero or minimal usage by design
- **Architecture Demonstration**: Focus on integration patterns rather than high-volume metrics
- **Cost-Conscious Development**: Showcases ability to build monitoring without budget impact
- **Production-Ready Foundation**: Framework easily scales to production workloads

### Value Proposition
- ✅ **Proves Integration Capability**: Demonstrates successful AWS API connectivity
- ✅ **Shows Architecture Understanding**: Illustrates proper monitoring stack design  
- ✅ **Cost-Effective Learning**: Explores enterprise tools within free tier limits
- ✅ **Scalability Foundation**: Provides framework for production deployment

*This approach demonstrates both technical competency and business awareness—building robust monitoring infrastructure while maintaining cost discipline.*
